# How to Use a Profinet Xml Viewer to Check and Edit GSD Files
 
Profinet is an open standard for industrial ethernet that supports a variety of automation devices and applications. GSD files are device description files that contain information about the basic capabilities, communication options and diagnostics of a Profinet device. GSD files are written in XML format, which is a standard way of structuring and exchanging data.

A Profinet Xml Viewer is a tool that can help you to view, check and edit GSD files for Profinet devices. It can show you the content of GSD files in an easy to understand table view, and also perform a syntax and semantics check according to the Profinet specifications. You can also use a built-in or external XML editor to make corrections or modifications to the GSD files without having to leave the tool.
 
One example of a Profinet Xml Viewer is the GSD Checker, which is provided free of charge by PROFIBUS Nutzerorganisation e.V. (Germany) to all members of PROFIBUS & PROFINET International (PI). You can download it from [here](https://www.profibus.com/download/profinet-gsd-checker/). The tool supports GSDML V2.43 and comes with pre-built binaries for the additional XML parsers Apache Xerces-C++ V3.2.3 and libxml2 V2.9.14. It also includes sample files that you can use as a starting point for your own GSD files.
 
To use the GSD Checker, you need to unzip the downloaded file and run the executable file. Then you can open a GSD file from your device or from the sample folder. The tool will display the content of the file in a table view, where you can see the attributes, values and descriptions of each element. You can also switch to a tree view or a text view if you prefer.
 
If you want to check the validity of your GSD file, you can click on the "Check" button on the toolbar. The tool will perform a validation check based on the Profinet specifications and report any errors or warnings in a separate window. You can double-click on any error or warning message to jump to the corresponding line in the text view.

If you want to edit your GSD file, you can either use the built-in XML editor or an external XML editor of your choice. The built-in XML editor allows you to make changes directly in the text view, while the external XML editor can be launched by clicking on the "Edit" button on the toolbar. You can also copy and paste elements from one file to another using the clipboard functions.
 
After editing your GSD file, you can save it and check it again using the tool. You can also export your GSD file as a PDF document or print it out for documentation purposes.
 
A Profinet Xml Viewer is a useful tool for anyone who works with Profinet devices and needs to view, check or edit their GSD files. It can help you to ensure that your device description files are accurate and compliant with the Profinet standards.
  
## How to Use a Profinet Xml Viewer to Compare and Merge GSD Files
 
Another feature of a Profinet Xml Viewer is the ability to compare and merge GSD files from different sources or versions. This can help you to identify and resolve any conflicts or inconsistencies between your GSD files, and to create a merged file that contains the best of both.
 
To use this feature, you need to open two GSD files that you want to compare or merge in the tool. You can do this by clicking on the "Open" button on the toolbar and selecting two files from your device or from the sample folder. The tool will display the content of both files in a split view, where you can see the differences highlighted in color.
 
You can also switch to a synchronized view or a combined view if you prefer. The synchronized view shows the same element in both files side by side, while the combined view shows the merged element in one file. You can use the navigation buttons on the toolbar to move between different elements or differences.
 
If you want to merge your GSD files, you can use the merge buttons on the toolbar to copy elements from one file to another. You can also edit elements in either file using the built-in or external XML editor. The tool will update the merged file automatically as you make changes.
 
After merging your GSD files, you can save the merged file and check it using the tool. You can also export your merged file as a PDF document or print it out for documentation purposes.
 
A Profinet Xml Viewer is a handy tool for anyone who works with Profinet devices and needs to compare or merge their GSD files. It can help you to ensure that your device description files are consistent and compatible with each other.
